# devops-auto-deploy-collection

This is a repo for all my devops tools auto deploy collection.
Most of them only need one single command to deploy all the component.
The core concept is to make it simple and stupid.
To keep it really friendly to use, some shell scripts have interactive UI.
All of them build with docker to avoid OS dependent and can run everywhere.
I prefer Alpine and Ubuntu as base image.
